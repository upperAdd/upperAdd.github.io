<p align="justify">This project is my first assignment doing data pre-processing and data visualisation. We use the dataset from Kaggle. In data science, data pre-processing refers to the step from extracting a dataset from the source until we clean our dataset from any duplicated or missing values. After that, our dataset is ready to explore or what we used to call Exploratory Data Analysis. On my first EDA that showed on my pie chart, I checked the top five locations with the biggest magnitude and if those locations were under the “Ring of Fire” or just in the most seismic region. Astonishingly based on exploration data, those locations are not the most frequently intense tectonic activities. The top five locations where earthquakes often occur in sequences were in the same county in America, CA, with 3 locations in the same place, “The Geysers”.

### Python Game - Adventure Game
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/upperAdd/Adventure-Game-DA_week-2)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
<p align="justify">This project is my favourite assignment to learn python as a programming language. We need to create adventure games that make the reader try to go into several rooms and have some blockage on the way out. I created this game inspired by Alice in Wonderland, but the situation I changed into vacation into a tropical island where readers need to have a diving license or advanced swimming skills to enjoy the vacation. I used a different colour to distinguish someone speaking either by themself or in a conversation between other people and the narrative story. I also put some intro to describe the situation on the beach before the reader starts the game to choose which path they want. Below is the screenshot of the game that I build.</p>
