We need to create adventure games that make the reader try to go on several room and have some blockaged of way out. i created this game by inspired with Alice in Wonderland but the scene i change into vacation into tropical island that reader can have diving license or advance skill of swim to enjoy the vacation. I used different colour to distinguish of someone speak either by themself or conversation between other people and the narative story. I also put some intro to describe the situation of the beach before the reader start the game to choose which path they want. Below is screenshot of the game that i build.</p>
